# Unreleased (since 4.5.4)

## Client

1. Add netstandard 2.0 target
2. Support query translation for builtin VB operators in projects compiled using VS 2017
3. Support using "soap" endpoint from client (Cross Platform)
  * native support for all platforms supporting netstandard 2
  * Run this code before creating first DomainContext, 
  ``` csharp
  DomainContext.DomainClientFactory = new OpenRiaServices.DomainServices.Client.Web.SoapDomainClientFactory()
{
    ServerBaseUri = "https://my.site.com/",
};
```
  * Limitations / differences from binary endpoint:
    * Standard query size limitations apply (no workaround as for binary endpoint)
    * invoke operations will use POST even when for operations with HasSideEffect=false
    * soap endpoint must be manually enabled on server
