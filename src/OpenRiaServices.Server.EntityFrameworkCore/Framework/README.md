This excludes usage by the Russian state, Russian state-owned companies, Russian education who spread propaganda instead of truth, anyone who work with the *filtration camps*, or finance the war by importing Russian oil or gas.

- You allow anonymized telemetry to collected and sent during the preview releases to gather feedback about usage



## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have setup and configured `OpenRiaServices.Hosting.AspNetCore`
2. Add a reference to *OpenRiaServices.Server.EntityFrameworkCore*
    `dotnet add package OpenRiaServices.Server.EntityFrameworkCore`
3. Add one or more domainservices. 
Given that you have a Ef Core model named `MyDbContext` with an entity `MyEntity` you add CRUD methods using something similar to below

```csharp
using using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using OpenRiaServices.Server.EntityFrameworkCore;

[EnableClientAccess]
public class MyDomainService : DbDomainService<MyDbContext>
{
    // Not required: But it is generally a good idea to allow dependency injection of DbContext
    public MyDomainService(MyDbContext dbContext)
        : base(context)
    { }

    /* Example of CUD methods */
    public void InsertMyEntity(MyEntity entity)
        => DbContext.Entry(entity).State = EntityState.Added; // Or  DbContext.Add, but it might add related entities differently

    public void UpdateMyEntity(MyEntity entity)
        => base.AttachAsModified(entity); // This sets state to Modified and set modified status on individual properties based on client changes and if `RountTripOriginal` attribute is specified or not

    public void DeleteMyEntity(MyEntity entity)
        => DbContext.Entry(entity).State =  EntityState.Deleted;

    /* Query: 
    * Return IQueryable<> to automatically allow the client to add filtering, paging etc. 
    * The queries are performed async for best performance
    */
    [Query]
    IQueryable<MyEntity> GetMyEntities()
        => DbContext.MyEntities.OrderBy(x => x.Id); // Sort by id to get stable Skip/Take if client does paging
}
```
4. Ensure that `MyDomainService` is mapped, (See [Setup instructions in OpenRiaServices.Hosting.AspNetCore readme](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenRiaServices.Hosting.AspNetCore))


## Owned Entities

* *one-to-one* relations using Owned Entities are fully supported
   * Any EF Core configuration/metadata applied to the owned entity (such as Required, MaxLength etc) are part of generated client Code
* *one-to-many* relations might work, but it has not been verified at the moment

### Owned Entities without explicit key
EF Core owned entities are mapped to OpenRiaServices's [Complex Types](https://openriaservices.gitbook.io/openriaservices/ee707348/ee707356/gg602753) as long as the owned entity does not have have an explicit key.


### Owned Entities with explicit key
If an explicit key to an owned entity then they are mapped as a normal entity and the navigation property to the owned entity adds `[Composition]` 

This makes the owned entity available during Insert, Update and Delete operations and prevents if from accidentaly having all fields set to `null`.

## Complex Types

The *Complex Types* introduced in EF Core 8 are *partially supported** with some limitations.

1. The types are mapped to to OpenRiaServices's [Complex Types]
2. Any ef core configuration/metadata applied to the ComplexType (as part of fluent configuration) **IS NOT** discovered.
The `DbDomainServiceDescriptionProvider` and `DbDomainService` classes does not have any special handling of *Complex Types*.
    * Attributes on the types are discovered as expected using the normal built in reflection based attribute discovery
