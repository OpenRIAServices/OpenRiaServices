The Tooling provides templates for both items and projects using Open Ria Services as well as tooling support for configuring code generation options.

Item Templates for "Domain Service" and "Authentication Service" for C# should work as expected, **other will probably give errors**
Project Template "Open Ria Services Library" for C# should work, **other will probably give errors**

The tooling is only tested with OpenRiaServices 4.6.0+ and on for server nuget packages.

Some of the errors (about invalid extension GUID should be solvable by also installing the tooling for VS 2015)
