The Tooling provides templates for both items and projects using Open Ria Services as well as tooling support for configuring code generation options.

Item Templates for "Domain Service" and "Authentication Service" for C# should work as expected, **other might give errors**
Project Template "Open Ria Services Library" for C# should work, **other might give errors**

The tooling is only tested with version 4.6.0-preview1 and on for server nuget packages.
