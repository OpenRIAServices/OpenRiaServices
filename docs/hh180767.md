# Silverlight Navigation Application Template

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

Use the Silverlight Navigation Application template for projects that require integration and navigation between two or more web pages.

## Silverlight Navigation Application Template

The Silverlight Navigation Application template adds features that implement the Frame and Page controls, URI mapping, Web browser integrated navigation, and browser history integration.

The Silverlight Navigation Application expands on the base Silverlight application template by adding the navigation bar at the top of the page, views for Login, Home, and About pages, and a Styles file. The Styles.xaml, Home.xaml, About.xaml, and Error.xaml files are included by referencing the assemblies listed in the procedure below.

The Silverlight Business Application template adds authentication, roles, and profiles to the Silverlight Navigation Application template, as well as localization. For more information about this template, see the [Silverlight Business Application Template](hh180769.md) topic.

Enabling Open Ria Services with this template makes the Open Ria Services programming model available to the user and establishes a Open Ria Services link between the client and server projects within the Open Ria Services solution.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The most recent Silverlight SDK and Open Ria Services Toolkit are required to use this template with Open Ria Services solutions. For information on installing these prerequisites, see <A href="gg512106(v=vs.91).md">Prerequisites for Open Ria Services</A>.
