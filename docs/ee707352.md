# ASP.NET Clients

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

Although the Open Ria Services framework is intended primarily to be used with Silverlight clients, you can also use it with other clients, such as ASP.NET clients. This approach enables you to use the same middle-tier logic across different types of clients. However, client code is not automatically generated when you use non-Silverlight clients.

The [Walkthrough: Using the Domain Service in ASP.NET Applications](ee807305.md) topic in this section describes how to call the domain services that you exposed in the Web server project for ASP.NET clients.
