# Silverlight Business Application Template

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

Use the Silverlight Business Application template for projects that require user registration, authentication, roles and profiles, as well as integration and navigation between two or more web pages and localization.

## Silverlight Business Application Template

The Silverlight Business Application template builds on the Silverlight Navigation Application template, adding built in authentication services (with Forms Authentication for the authentication mode) user registration, and localization. It is the most fully featured and robust of the templates provided in the Silverlight SDK. It enables Open Ria Services automatically, providing a Open Ria Services link between the Silverlight client and server projects within the solution. The authentication services included in this template are designed to setup not only user identification for the developer, but also registration and management. Helper classes are added including DataFieldExtensions.cs, NotOperatorValueConverter.cs, and TargetNullValueConverter.cs. Also, the System.Windows.Controls.Data.DataForm.Toolkit library is included along with the RegistrationDataResources.resx and ValidationErrorResources.resx files. This template is the best starting place for writing a complex Open Ria Services business application that uses a Silverlight client.

For walkthroughs that use this complex template, see the [Walkthrough: Using the Silverlight Business Application Template](ee707360.md) and the [How to: Add Business Logic to the Domain Service](ee796240.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
