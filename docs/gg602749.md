# Accessing non-Silverlight Clients

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

Although Open Ria Services is currently optimized to work with a Silverlight client in the sense that is supports the automatic code generation of the Silverlight client proxy, the domain service can be called from other .NET clients such as an ASP.NET client. For details on this scenario, see the [ASP.NET Clients](ee707352.md) and [Walkthrough: Using the Domain Service in ASP.NET Applications](ee807305.md) topics in this section.
