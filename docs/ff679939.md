# Deploying and Localizing a Open Ria Services Solutions

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

After you have created a Open Ria Services application in a development environment, it remains to deploy and localize the application. This topic describes procedures for this tasks and a topic on how to troubleshoot some common issues that arise when deploying a Open Ria Services solution.

## Deploying a Open Ria Services Solution

To deploy your Open Ria Services solution, you must make sure that the .NET Framework 4 and IIS are installed on the Web server, the Open Ria Services assemblies are available to the application, and the Web.config file on the Web server has been properly configured with the required values. For more information on how to publish a Open Ria Services application, see [A Guide to Deploying Open Ria Services Solutions](ff426912.md).

## Troubleshooting the Deployment of a Open Ria Services Solution

Troubleshooting a Open Ria Services solution presents a unique challenge because an exception can occur at one of many different layers. You need to understand how these different layers report errors to effectively troubleshoot your application. For more information, see [Troubleshooting the Deployment of a Open Ria Services Solution](ff426913.md).

## Localizing a Open Ria Services Solution

In a Open Ria Services solution, you can provide localized values in both the client and server project. The domain service will provide the correct version of the values based on the user's language preference. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Localizing a Business Application](ff679940.md).
