# How to: Create a Domain Service that uses POCO-defined Entities

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

This topic shows how to use Open Ria Services to create a domain service that uses Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO). The objective is to show how to construct a very elementary POCO-based Open Ria Services application that explains, in particular, exactly what happens when the Open Ria Services tools (wizards and dialogue boxes) are used during various steps in the procedure. Data served up from POCO can be used to free an application from dependencies on backend databases for the purpose of portability or data security, or for testing purposes. The automatically generated client code is fully supported by Open Ria Services with POCO-defined entities as it is with Linq to SQL or to Entity Framework. The Open Ria Services domain service is, in fact, agnostic with regard to the data source, so this POCO class could be replaced later by a component that accesses data from some other source such as a database without changing the domain service itself.

For a walkthrough that outlines how to use a code first approach to initialize a database that is then made available to a Silverlight client for editing and viewing, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Open Ria Service with the Code First Approach](hh556025.md).

The procedure described here requires several prerequisite programs, such as Visual Studio and the Silverlight Developer Runtime and SDK, be installed and configured properly, in addition to Open Ria Services. But the Open Ria Services Toolkit is not required. Detailed instructions for the satisfaction of each of these prerequisites are provided by the topics within the [Prerequisites for Open Ria Services](gg512106.md) node. Follow the instructions provided there for the programs required before proceeding with this how-to to ensure that you encounter as few problems as possible.

### Create a Open Ria Services solution

1.  Create a new Open Ria Services project in Visual Studio by selecting **File**, **New**, and then **Project**.
    
    The **New Project** dialog box appears.

2.  Select the **Silverlight Application** template from **Silverlight** group of the **Installed Templates** and name the new project RIAServicesPocoExample.

3.  Click **OK**.
    
    The **New Silverlight Application** dialog box appears.

4.  Select the **Enable Open Ria Services** check box near the bottom of the dialog box. Checking this box creates a Open Ria Services link between the client project and the server project. To enable this connection this tool adds the following references to the client project:
    
      - System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
    
      - System.Runtime.Serialization
    
      - System.ServiceModel.dll
    
      - OpenRiaServices.Client
    
      - OpenRiaServices.Client.Web
    
      - System.ServiceModel.Web.Extensions
    
      - System.Windows.Browser

5.  Click **OK** to create the solution.
    
    The solution contains two projects: a client project and a server project.
    
      - RIAServicesPocoExample: the client project that contains the Silverlight code that you use to create the presentation tier.
    
      - RIAServicesPocoExample.Web: the server project that contains that middle tier code.

### Create a Domain Service

1.  Right-click the server project, select **Add** and **New Item**.

2.  In the list of categories, select **Web** and then select the **Domain Service Class** template.

3.  Name the class SovereignDomainService.cs (or SovereignDomainService.vb).

4.  Click **Add**.
    
    The **Add New Domain Service Class** dialog box appears.

5.  Make sure that the **Enable client access** box is checked.

6.  Note that the only option available on the dropdown menu for the **Available DataContext/ObjectContext classes** is the **\<empty Domain Service class\>** entity and that you cannot select the **Generated associated classes for metadata** check-box because there are no data contexts available with which to associate the service.

7.  Click **OK**.
    
    This wizard does several things. It generates an empty SovereignDomainService class in a new SovereignDomainService.cs (or SovereignDomainService.vb) file with associated attributes and using statements. It also adds four assembly references to the service project and configuration elements to the Web.config file.

8.  To observe this, open the SovereignDomainService.cs (or SovereignDomainService.vb) file if it is has not opened automatically already. Notice that the file has the following characteristics:
    
    1.  using statements have been added:
        
          - using System;
        
          - using System.Collections.Generic;
        
          - using System.ComponentModel;
        
          - using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
        
          - using System.Linq;
        
          - using OpenRiaServices.Hosting;
        
          - using OpenRiaServices.Server
    
    2.  The SovereignDomainService class derives from [DomainService](ff422911.md) class, which is an abstract base class in the Open Ria Services framework. This is the base class for all the domain service exposed in Open Ria Services.
    
    3.  The SovereignDomainService class is marked with the EnableClientAccessAttribute attribute to indicate that it is visible to the client tier.

9.  Notice that the following references have been added to the service project by the wizard:
    
      - System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
    
      - System.Runtime.Serialization
    
      - OpenRiaServices.Hosting
    
      - OpenRiaServices.Server

10. Finally open the Web.config file and examine the new elements that have been added by the wizard.
    
        <configuration>
            <system.webServer>
                <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true">
                    <add name="DomainServiceModule" preCondition="managedHandler"
                        type="OpenRiaServices.Hosting.DomainServiceHttpModule, OpenRiaServices.Hosting, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" />
                </modules>
                <validation validateIntegratedModeConfiguration="false" />
            </system.webServer>
            <system.web>
                <httpModules>
                    <add name="DomainServiceModule" type="OpenRiaServices.Hosting.DomainServiceHttpModule, OpenRiaServices.Hosting, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35" />
                </httpModules>
                <compilation debug="true" targetFramework="4.0" />
            </system.web>
        
            <system.serviceModel>
                <serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled="true"
                    multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true" />
            </system.serviceModel>
        </configuration>
    
    Except for the configuration element targeting the .NET Framework 4.0, each of these elements has been added by the **Add New Domain Service Class** dialog. These elements enable various Internet Information Server (IIS) hosting and ASP.NET options.
    
    1.  The wizard adds a \<modules\> element in the \<system.webserver\> section that is required by IIS 7 hosting.
    
    2.  The wizard adds an \<add\> element of the \<httpModules\> element within the system.web section that is required by IIS 6 hosting.
    
    3.  Open Ria Services domain services are Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services and when hosted with ASP.NET need to be hosted in ASP.NET Compatibility Mode. This requirement cannot be set in code and must be specified in the Web.config file. The ASP.NET Compatibility Mode is enabled by setting the aspNetCompatibilityEnabled property to true in the \<ServiceHostingEnvironment\>element of the \<system.serviceModel\> section.

### Add the POCO class

1.  This procedure describes how to indicate to the Open Ria Services framework that a POCO class is to be used as an entity type. Entity types provide data structures to the application’s data model and each entity type is required to have a unique entity key. The structure of the data is specified by the set of properties it contains. The entity key is provided by deputizing a property (or set of properties) that must provide a unique name for each entity object that distinguishes it from other entities of the same type. This is typically specified by using metadata of some variety. This procedure does this by applying the \[Key\] attribute to a property and it is, in fact, the application of this attribute that tells the Open Ria Services framework that instances of the POCO class are entity objects.

2.  Open up the SovereignDomainSevice.cs file.

3.  Within the scope of the RIAServicesPocoExample.Web namespace, below the stubbed out SovereignDomainService class, add the following code for the Sovereign class:
    
    ``` 
        
    public class Sovereign
        {
            [Key]
            public int UniqueId { get; set; }
            public string Name { get; set; }
            public string House { get; set; }
            public string Dominion { get; set; }
            public int ReignStart { get; set; }
            public int ReignEnd { get; set; }
            public string Sobriquet { get; set; }
        }
    ```

4.  In this example, the UniqueId property is the entity key that provides a unique name for each entity object of type Sovereign. The \[Key\] attribute is defined in the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations assembly, which has already been added to the server project, as has the using statement for the corresponding namespace that contains it. The entity key could also be specified in a metadata file or in other ways, but this is a convenient way to indicate this directly in the POCO class.

5.  Add the FetchSovereigns() method to the Sovereign class that returns a list of Sovereign instances:
    
    ``` 
            
    public List<Sovereign> FetchSovereigns()
            {
                List<Sovereign> sovereignList = new List<Sovereign>
                {
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 1, 
                     Name = "John", 
                     House = "Plantagenet", 
                     Dominion = "Angevin Empire", 
                     ReignStart = 1167, 
                     ReignEnd = 1216, 
                     Sobriquet = "Lackland"
                    },
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 2, 
                     Name = "Charles", 
                     House = "Stuart", 
                     Dominion = "England, Scotland, & Ireland", 
                     ReignStart = 1625, 
                     ReignEnd = 1649, 
                     Sobriquet = "The Martyr"
                    },
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 3, 
                     Name = "William", 
                     House = "Dunkeld", 
                     Dominion = "Scotland", 
                     ReignStart = 1165, 
                     ReignEnd = 1249, 
                     Sobriquet = "The Lion"
                    },   
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 4, 
                     Name = "Elizabeth", 
                     House = "Tudor", 
                     Dominion = "England", 
                     ReignStart = 1555, 
                     ReignEnd = 1609, 
                     Sobriquet = "The Virgin Queen"
                    },
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 5, 
                     Name = "Ivan", 
                     House = "Vasilyevich", 
                     Dominion = "Russia", 
                     ReignStart = 1533, 
                     ReignEnd = 1584, 
                     Sobriquet = "The Terrible"
                    },
                new Sovereign()
                    {UniqueId = 6, 
                     Name = "Charles", 
                     House = "Valois", 
                     Dominion = "France", 
                     ReignStart = 1380, 
                     ReignEnd = 1422, 
                     Sobriquet = "The Mad"
                    }
                };
            return sovereignList;
            }
    ```

### Define the Domain Service

1.  This procedure describes how to create a query in the domain service that will be accessible from the client to retrieve data from the POCO defined entities. The Open Ria Services framework needs to know which of its methods are to be made available on the client as queries and there is a naming convention used to achieve this. Method names that start with Get and that return either an IEnumerable\<EntityType\> or an IQueryable\<EntityType\> are recognized by the Open Ria Services framework as queries.
    

    > [!TIP]
    > <A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb351562">IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</A> derives from <A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eekhta0">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</A>. Use <A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eekhta0">IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</A> for in-memory collections such as our POCO defined entities and use <A href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb351562">IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</A> when accessing an underlying or remote data source like a SQL database.


2.  Add the GetSovereign() method to the SovereignDomainService class.
    
    ``` 
           
            public IEnumerable<Sovereign> GetSovereigns()
            { 
                Sovereign sovereign = new Sovereign();
                return sovereign.FetchSovereigns();
            }
    ```

3.  This returns the all of the sovereign entities from the collection. But, typically, we only want to return a subset of the entities. To illustrate this, modify this query to return only the sovereigns from this list that reigned during the Middle Ages, that is where sovereign.ReignEnd \<= 1500. The following code does this:
    
    ``` 
            public IEnumerable<Sovereign> GetSovereignsByReignEnd(int ReignedBefore)
            {
                Sovereign sovereign = new Sovereign();
                return sovereign.FetchSovereigns().Where<Sovereign>(p => p.ReignEnd <= 1500);
            }
    ```

4.  Build (Ctrl+Shift+B) the solution to create the auto-generated client proxy code.

5.  In **Solution Explorer**, select the **RIAServicesPocoExample** client project and click the **Show All Files** icon at the top of the window and examine the RIAServicesPocoExample.Web.g.cs file in the Generated\_Code folder. Examine the auto-generated code in this file and take note of the following items:
    
      - A WebContext class that derives from the [WebContextBase](ff457966.md) class is generated and used to manage the application context.
    
      - A Sovereign class that derives from the [Entity](ff422907.md) class is generated for the entity exposed by the domain service. The Sovereign entity class in the client project matches the Sovereign entity on the server.
    
      - A SovereignDomainContext class that derives from the [DomainContext](ff422732.md) class is generated. This class has a method named GetSovereignsByReignEndQuery that corresponds to the query method created in the domain service.

6.  For more information on the automatic code generation, see the [Client Code Generation](ee707359.md) topic. For information on how to customize code generation, see the [Customizing Generated Code](ee707345.md) topics.

### Display the query result in the Silverlight client

1.  Open MainPage.xaml.

2.  From the **Toolbox** on the left, drag a DataGrid control to within the Grid element in XAML view.
    
    Dragging the **DataGrid** control from the **Toolbox** causes a namespace using System.Windows.Controls statement to be added to the MainPage.xaml.cs file and references to the System.Windows.Controls.Data and System.Windows.Controls.Data.Input assemblies to be added automatically to the client project.
    

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you add the DataGrid without dragging it from the <STRONG>Toolbox</STRONG>, you must add the references to the assemblies to the client project and the using statement manually in the code behind file.


3.  Change the value of the AutoGeneratedColums to True, name the DataGrid element SovereignGrid, and adjust the Height and Width as shown in the following XAML.
    
    ``` 
        
    <Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot" Background="White">
         <sdk:DataGrid AutoGenerateColumns="True" 
                       Height="200" 
                       HorizontalAlignment="Left" 
                       Margin="157,86,0,0" 
                       Name="SovereignGrid" 
                       VerticalAlignment="Top"
                       Width="600" />
    </Grid>
    ```

4.  Open the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

5.  Add using (C\#) or Imports (Visual Basic) two statements: using RIAServicesPocoExample.Web; and the using OpenRiaServices.Client;.
    
    The RIAServicesPocoExample.Web namespace is the namespace containing the generated code for the client project in the RIAServicesPocoExample.Web.g.cs (or RIAServicesPocoExample.Web.g.vb).

6.  To instantiate the SovereignDomainContext, add the line of code private SovereignDomainContext \_sovereignContext = new SovereignDomainContext(); in the MainPage class.

7.  Retrieve customer entities by calling the GetSovereignsQuery method with [LoadOperation\<TEntity\>](ff423147.md): LoadOperation\<Sovereign\> loadOp = this.\_sovereignContext.Load(this.\_sovereignContext.GetSovereignsByReignEndQuery(1500));.

8.  Bind the entities loaded to the DataGrid with SovereignGrid.ItemsSource = loadOp.Entities;.
    
    To summarize, the MainPage.xaml.cs file should now contain the following code:
    
        //Namespaces added
        using RIAServicesPocoExample.Web;
        using OpenRiaServices.Client;
        
        namespace RIAServicesPocoExample
        {
            public partial class MainPage : UserControl
        
            {
                private SovereignDomainContext _sovereignContext = new SovereignDomainContext();
        
                public MainPage()
                {
                    
                    InitializeComponent();
        
                      LoadOperation<Sovereign> loadOp = this._sovereignContext.Load(this._sovereignContext.GetSovereignsByReignEndQuery(1500));
                      SovereignGrid.ItemsSource = loadOp.Entities;
                }
            }
        }

9.  Run (F5) the application.
    
    You should see the table in the browser displaying the properties only of the medieval (whose reigns ended before 1500 Common Era) sovereigns (in alphabetic order).
