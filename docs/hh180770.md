# Silverlight Application Template

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

Use the Silverlight Application template for projects that require only a single Web page and do not require any authentication, or when you just want to design everything from the ground up.

## Silverlight Application Template

The Silverlight Application template is the most basic of the Silverlight templates. It contains only the bare minimum files in the Silverlight project and does not include any other features such as a navigation framework or authentication.

The other application templates extend this basic template. The Silverlight navigation Application template adds Frame and Page controls to enable integration and navigation between pages. The Silverlight Business Application template adds authentication, roles, and profiles to the Silverlight Navigation Application template, as well as localization. For more information about this template, see the [Silverlight Navigation Application Template](hh180767.md) and [Silverlight Business Application Template](hh180769.md) topics.

Enabling Open Ria Services with this template makes the Open Ria Services programming model available to the user and establishes a Open Ria Services link between the client and server projects within the Open Ria Services solution.


{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** The most recent Silverlight SDK and Open Ria Services Toolkit are required to use this template with Open Ria Services solutions. For information on installing these prerequisites, see <A href="gg512106(v=vs.91).md">Prerequisites for Open Ria Services</A>.
{% endhint %}


For walkthroughs that use this basic template, see the [Walkthrough: Using the Silverlight Business Application Template](ee707360.md) and the [How to: Add Business Logic to the Domain Service](ee796240.md).
