# How to: Add Explicit Transactions to a Domain Service

\[ **This document was written for WCF Services Version 1 Service Pack 2 and might not be up to date** <br />
Please see [Release Notes](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/releases) or [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRIAServices/OpenRiaServices/blob/main/Changelog.md) for a list of changes since WCF RIA Services \]

This topic explains how you can use explicit transactions in your Open Ria Services domain service to guarantee that a set of changes are performed as a group. When you call [SubmitChanges()](./ff422324) from the client on the [DomainContext](./ff422732), it calls [Submit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/m:system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.domainservice.submit\(system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.changeset\)\(v=VS.91\)) on the server. So transactions can be incorporated by overriding [Submit(ChangeSet)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/m:system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.domainservice.submit\(system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.changeset\)\(v=VS.91\)) method with the base implementation and wrapping it in a transaction scope. This, in turn, calls PersistChangeSet which finalizes all the CUD (Create, Update and Delete) operations that have been invoked.

This procedure is only required to integrate transactions into a domain service that derives directly from the [DomainService](./ff422911) class, as is the case, for example, when working with POCO (Plain Old CLR Objects) defined data models. When the domain service is derive from [LinqToEntitiesDomainService\<TContext\>](./ff423019) using Entity Framework, the transaction is handled automatically.

The procedure described in this topic assumes that you have a Open Ria Services application created. The procedures for doing this can be followed in the [Walkthrough: Creating a Open Ria Services Solution](./ee707376) topic.

### To create an explicit transaction

1.  Right-click the server project and select the **Add Reference** option to open the **Add Reference** window. On the **.NET** tab, find and select the System.Transactions assembly and then click **OK**.

2.  In the domain service, override the [Submit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/m:system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.domainservice.submit\(system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.changeset\)\(v=VS.91\)) method.

3.  Create a transaction scope that wraps a call to the base implementation of the [Submit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/m:system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.domainservice.submit\(system.servicemodel.domainservices.server.changeset\)\(v=VS.91\)) method.

4.  Check the [HasError](./ff423256) property on the [ChangeSet](./ff422535) object before completing the transaction.
    
    The following example shows an explicit transaction for a domain service.
    
    ``` vb
    <EnableClientAccess()>  _
    Public Class DomainService1
        Inherits DomainService
    
        Public Overrides Function Submit(ByVal changeSet As System.Web.DomainServices.ChangeSet) As Boolean
            Dim result As Boolean
    
            Using tx = New TransactionScope( _
                    TransactionScopeOption.Required, _
                    New TransactionOptions With {.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted})
    
                result = MyBase.Submit(changeSet)
                If (Not Me.ChangeSet.HasError) Then
                    tx.Complete()
                End If
            End Using
            Return result
        End Function
    End Class
    ```
    
    ``` csharp
    [EnableClientAccess()]
    public class DomainService1 : DomainService
    {
        public override bool Submit(ChangeSet changeSet)
        {
            bool result;
    
            using (var tx = new TransactionScope(
                TransactionScopeOption.Required,
                new TransactionOptions { IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted })
                )
            {
                result = base.Submit(changeSet);
                if (!this.ChangeSet.HasError)
                {
                    tx.Complete();
                }
            }
    
            return result;
        }
    }
    ```
